### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics**, **Virtual Reality**, and **AI applications**. I'm particularly interested in:

- 3D & 4D Scene Generation (3D Gaussian Splatting)
- VR/AR with AI application
- Multimodal AI Systems(ex. Vision + Audio)
- Human and Computer Interaction(HCI)
